# Car-price-Prediction-Web-App

This repository consists of files required for end to end implementation and deployment of Machine Learning Car Price Prediction web application created with Flask and deployed on Heroku platform.

## About the App

The Car Price Prediction is a flask web application which predicts car prices based on certain given parameters such as Year, Showroom Price(lakhs), Kilometers Driven, Previous Owners, Fuel Type, Dealer or Individual and Transmission Type. The dataset is available at Kaggle, and it's provided by cardekho.com. 

For Developing the project I have used Flask Framework as base. I have used HTML and CSS for developing basic structure of the project. All the coding part is implemented using Jupyter Notebook and Python Language. 

## Major Tools used for Project Development:

  * Python ( 3.7 version)

  * Jupyter Notebook

  * Flask

  * Seaborn
  
  * Scipy

  * SkLearn

  * Pandas

  * Numpy
  
  * gunicorn

  * HTML

  * CSS

## For using the project use the following commands :

  * $ git clone
  * $ set FLASK_APP= app.py
  * $ flask run
  
 
The whole project is deployed on Heroku Cloud.
